# example-opentelemetry
Docker compose file to use OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, Prometheus and Grafana with Jina. The example docker-compose file is extracted from the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/examples/demo/docker-compose.yaml) repository and modified slightly to minimize the features.
